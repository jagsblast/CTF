Advanced Detection and Response
Have any of the detected PowerShell scripts used encoded commands or obfuscation techniques recently?

Were there any anomalies detected in process creation or command-line arguments that might indicate a script execution?

Network and Host Activity Analysis
What unusual patterns or anomalies can be observed in network traffic involving internal or local IP addresses?

Identify any endpoint communications that involve IP addresses or ports frequently used by known adversary tools or techniques.

File Integrity and Modification
Have there been any unauthorized modifications or executions of files in sensitive directories (e.g., C:\Windows\System32) detected?

What files in the C:\Windows\Temp directory were accessed or modified at irregular times or intervals?

Security Control Bypass Techniques
What specific attempts have been made to modify or disable endpoint protection mechanisms, and what were their outcomes?

Analyze any detected exclusion or bypass activities to identify if they correlate with known evasion techniques.

Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement
What indicators suggest the use of privilege escalation tools or techniques, and how were they executed?

Have there been any detected movements between high-privilege accounts or systems that could indicate lateral movement?

Unusual Software and Repository Activities
Have there been any instances of software being executed from paths or repositories not traditionally used within the organization?

Analyze any network activity related to GitHub or other version control systems for potential exfiltration or command-and-control operations.

Command Execution Patterns
Identify any anomalous patterns in the execution of commands that involve nc.exe or similar network utilities.

What command-line arguments used in recent executions are indicative of scripted or automated activities?

Incident Correlation and Context
Correlate any detected activities with known threat actor TTPs to identify potential attack patterns or techniques used.

Review historical incidents to determine if recent activities align with patterns observed in previous security breaches.

Endpoint Behavior Analysis
Examine the behavior of endpoints to identify any anomalous execution sequences or unauthorized tool usage.

What indicators suggest the presence of automated scripts or tools running with elevated privileges on the endpoints?
